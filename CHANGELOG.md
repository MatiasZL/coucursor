# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Coucursor fork: the GitHub macOS build is named **Coucursor** (bundle id unchanged).
- Chat is **ClinePass only**: Settings → Chat stores a Cline API key (`cline-api-key`); models use `https://api.cline.bot/api/v1` (OpenAI-compatible). Pastille `ai_clinepass`. Other chat providers (Anthropic / Google / OpenAI / Cursor Cloud Agents / Ollama / LM Studio) are removed from this build.
- Cursor stays as **hooks only** (Settings → Agents → Cursor Hooks → `~/.cursor/hooks.json`).
- **Cursor shell Allow/Deny**: `beforeShellExecution` opens Allow / Deny / Always in the notch (Always = Coucursor allowlist). Wait up to **5 minutes**; timeout or Coucursor down → `ask` in Cursor (never auto-allow). **Update hooks** if the timeout is still short.
- Finished session card (and ⌃⌥T): **Open Cursor** / **Open Codex** when that agent finished, instead of always opening Terminal.
- **Focus** behavior preset + toggles: peek on music, expand on finished / programming / CI (alerts always open).
- **Today** session memory: finished sessions saved locally; day pulse + Overview strip + end-of-day tip after 18:00; tap pulse for the list.
- **⌃⌥E** opens the last / pinned file in the editor; programming rail shows Today files; diffs soft-retain ~1h after SessionEnd.
- Settings → General: **Click outside to close** (on by default) collapses the expanded notch when you click outside the island.
- Cursor live diff: `afterFileEdit` / Write / Edit open the notch diff card automatically (typewriter on the new line, strikethrough on removals), same path as Claude Code Edit/Write. The island force-expands so the card is visible while programming.
- Ticker step labels are English (Reads / Writes / Edits / Runs…) instead of French.
- Live programming view (tall island): Edit/MultiEdit opens Read/Edit/Bash/Done rail + inset code editor (file tab, line numbers, keyword tint, typewriter on `+`, strikethrough on `−`). Huge full-file Write dumps stay ticker-only.
- **Render** integration: API key in Settings, `integration_render` pill, deploy list/detail (polls `api.render.com`).
- **Spotify** integration (GitHub build): `integration_spotify` pill (`#1DB954`), now-playing card + play/pause/prev/next via AppleScript and `PlaybackStateChanged`; Mochi dances while Spotify plays.
- Spotify card: volume up/down (0–100) and Launch/Open Spotify from the notch; transport controls launch the desktop app if it isn’t running.
- Compact notch: info ticker crawls now-playing, live agent edits, or a short day pulse (deploys / PRs); tap toggles play/pause when a track is showing.
- Song change peeks the compact strip when **Stay collapsed until hover** is on; peek length scales with the measured song-title width so the name can scroll into view. Mochi does a happy emote on new tracks and on deploy / session finish.
- Shared `AppLauncher`: every ↗ / Open control uses Dock-style reopen + activate so minimized apps (and browsers for web integrations) come back to the front.
- Apple Music card: volume slider (0–100), same pattern as Spotify.
- Global media shortcuts (GitHub build): ⌃⌥P play/pause, ⌃⌥F next track (Spotify preferred when active).
- Compact alert badge on Mochi for pending approval / CI-deploy error / finished.
- Session end step includes a +/− file summary (`+42 −11 in 3 files`); pin a file in the programming view so edits keep that tab open.
- Mochi wears sunglasses while music plays (overrides seasonal Auto; also on the Spotify/Music pill); Settings → General → Mochi: pick an outfit (or open the notch wardrobe); idle breathing + Quiet / Alive presets; one-shot tip after first greeting.
- Settings → General: **Follow cursor when idle** (eyes in the smallest strip) and **Stay collapsed until hover** (rest hidden; expand on hover; alerts still force-open).

## 0.1.7 — October 4, 2026

- Keyboard shortcuts from anywhere: ⌃⌥Space opens the chat, ⌃⌥A jumps to a waiting permission or question, ⌃⌥T brings your terminal forward, ⌃⌥] and ⌃⌥[ switch pills, ⌃⌥M mutes Mochi, ⌃⌥D sends him to the desktop and back, ⌃⌥G opens the wardrobe, and ⌃⌥W attaches the front window to the chat (GitHub build) (#205)
- In the open island: ⌘← ⌘→ and ⌘1–9 switch pills, ⌘↑ ⌘↓ and ⌘O move through a card's list, ⌘E opens the diff, ⌘↩ sends, ⌘K starts a new chat, ⌘P pins the island (#205)
- Every global shortcut can be changed or turned off in Settings → Shortcuts, which also flags combinations another app already uses. They need no Accessibility permission (#205)
- ⌘⇧N now opens and closes the island (#205)

## 0.1.6 — October 4, 2026

- Mochi on the desktop: drag him out of the notch and drop him anywhere on your desktop. He hangs out there, follows your cursor with his eyes, wears his outfit and dances to your music (#198)
- When Claude needs you, he flies back to the notch with the permission or the question, then returns to his spot once you answer. He does a happy jump when a task finishes (#198)
- Click him to poke him, right-click for the wardrobe, drop him on a window to attach it to the chat (GitHub build), and drop him on the notch or double-click him to bring him home (#198)
- He falls asleep when nothing is going on, and remembers his spot between launches (#198)

## 0.1.5 — October 4, 2026

- Dress Mochi up: right-click him to open the wardrobe and pick a party hat, beanie, crown, witch hat, Santa hat, bunny ears, bow, sunglasses, round glasses, scarf or pumpkin, all drawn in code (#195)
- Auto mode dresses Mochi for the seasons on his own (#195)
- Outfits follow his head in 3D, glasses stay on his eyes, soft parts react when you tap or move him, and outfits come and go with a transition. Only the main Mochi wears them (#195)
- A new launch greeting: Mochi drops into the island, bounces, slides to the side and waves hello with a quick little hand, then comes back, with a new soft whisper of a sound (#196)
- Mochi's body is no longer clipped at two corners during the greeting (#196)

## 0.1.4 — October 3, 2026

- See what Claude is editing, live: each file edit shows up in the session ticker with its +N −M lines, and a click opens the diff right in the notch (#177)
- When Claude finishes, the session card shows its final message instead of the last step, without the shimmer (#177, #179)
- GitHub pill: your open pull requests with their CI status, the pull requests waiting for your review, and the CI of the default branch of your recent repos. Click a row for the list, then an item to open it on github.com (#181)
- GitHub alerts: a badge and a sound when the CI of one of your pull requests turns red or green, when a default branch breaks, or when someone requests your review. Fast CI runs are caught too, and the card refreshes when you open it (#181, #185)
- Your GitHub contribution grid: the last 7 days in the GitHub card header, click it for the past 23 weeks, and click a day for its count (#187)
- The GitHub token needs read access to pull requests and CI: a classic token with the repo scope, or a fine-grained token with read access to Pull requests, Commit statuses and Actions (#181)
- The finished view no longer overflows the card (#179)

## 0.1.3 — October 3, 2026

- Answer Claude's questions from the notch: when Claude Code asks a multiple-choice question, pick an option or type your own answer right in the island, and Reply in terminal hands it back. Update your hooks in Settings to turn it on (#165) — thanks @Vega8991 for the idea (#94)
- Claude plan usage (GitHub build): turn on Settings → Agents → Plan usage to see your 5-hour and weekly limits in a small pill in the notch header, and click it for the details and reset times. Pro and Max plans; your current status line keeps working (#159)
- Chat with local models through Ollama or LM Studio, no API key needed: connect them in Settings → Chat → Local models. Answers stream in, and thinking blocks stay hidden (#156)
- Markdown in chat answers: bold, lists, headings, quotes, and code blocks with a copy button. Links open only when they are web links (#156)
- Apple Music (GitHub build): see what is playing in the notch, play, pause and skip on hover, and Mochi dances along (#144, #153)
- Settings are now organized in a sidebar (#153)
- The chat greets you by your own first name (#154)

## 0.1.2 — October 2, 2026

- Codex support (GitHub build): sessions show up live on the Codex pill, and permission requests get Allow and Deny in the notch. Install from Settings → Codex Hooks, then trust the hooks once with /hooks in Codex (#130) — thanks @lacatu5
- Cursor: Claude Code started in Cursor's terminal shows up on the Cursor pill, and you can answer its permission requests from the notch (#120).
- Pick your main coding tool in Settings → Active pills: VS Code, Cursor, Codex or Antigravity (Codex and Antigravity: GitHub build). It stays on and no longer takes one of the 4 slots (#120).
- The permission card stays in the notch until you answer it: the mouse no longer folds it, and reopening the island shows the request again (#117).
- The permission card also shows when the island is already open, and the pill you were on comes back once you answer (#120).

## 0.1.1 — October 2, 2026

- Declare the tools you use in Settings: Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Anthropic, Google AI and OpenAI pills join the existing ones (Cursor and Codex pills are coming soon), and you pick the main pill.
- Chat now supports Google AI (Gemini) and OpenAI in addition to Anthropic; switch provider and model by clicking the model name in the chat view, on macOS.
- Linux version: the Tauri app now builds for Linux too (AppImage, .deb, .rpm), with the island as a layer-shell overlay on Wayland and Claude Code hooks over a private Unix socket (#21) — thanks @Davy133
- Compact island on screens without a notch (#22) — thanks @Kamasoutra
- Only web links (http/https) open from the notch; other kinds of links from Claude or integrations are ignored (#16) — thanks @Cris1670
- Hook socket limited to your own user account, with size and time limits; logs no longer keep commands, n8n data or full URLs, and stay under 1 MB (#16) — thanks @Cris1670 and @Vignesh-Thangamariappan
- The island always reopens after folding, and Settings opens below it, resizable — thanks @rouderz
- Choose the Claude model for the chat in Settings; the list comes from your Anthropic account, and Claude Sonnet 4.6 stays the default — thanks @rouderz
- Windows build artifacts are now downloadable from a manual CI run — thanks @MysJofR
- Any agent can talk to Mochi: tag a hook payload with `coucou_agent` (e.g. `nb-hook --agent my-agent`) and it gets its own pill in the island (#7, #9) — thanks @lacatu5
- Gemini CLI and Antigravity (agy) hook support on macOS: install from Settings and their sessions show up in the island — thanks @corefusiion
